## Distinctiveness and Complexity:
I believe my project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements because I used all programming languages that I learned on the course, it is a mobile-responsive web app, its use Django on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end. I think that can easily be used in a real project (with some adjustments) because it's a web app that many people uses in their daily routine to get hired in a job. Thinking about that I decide to develop this awesome web app as my last project.
